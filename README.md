SUIDOPWN is a toolset written in Python. It focuses around vulnerable SETUID binaries on Unix systems. The suido/suido-shell.txt scripts automate SETUID privilege escalation techniques.

Suido is a full function script which includes a binary scanner and a search functionality. 

Suido-shell.txt is SUID bit scanner and auto exploiter that can be copy and pasted into a reverse bash shell, when the user is unable to remotely transfer files to the target. 

Suidoblue is a blue-team focused script. It also scans for vulnerable binaries, but rather than exploit, it automatically changes the permissions to all vulnerable binaries.
